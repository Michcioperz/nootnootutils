nootnootutils is a wheel reinvention of a certain subgroup of coreutils and
such, inspired by a heavy misunderstanding in a certain project's Slack::

   <person A> g++ is the C++ compiler, gcc is not
   <person B> but if I run `man g++` it shows me this:
   <person B> `gcc - GNU project C and C++ compiler`
   <person A> see, it says `project`, nothing about `compiler`
   <person B> did you just skip the rest of the sentence after `project`?
   <person B> what's next, `echo - display a`?

===============
Available tools
===============

* echo - display a

* cat - concatenate files
  (but don't print them)

* ls - list directory

  The command will connect to kernel.org and print the names of the mailing
  lists hosted on there.
